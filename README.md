# Racecar-Evolution
The goal for this assignment is to utilize a neural network along with a genetic algorithm
to have a population of racecars evolve and choose better and better routes around a racetrack.

These racecars move around, depending on signals from their sensors - located in front of each racecar.

The sensors detect the color of the background and the racecars move accordingly - that's how they know which way to go.
